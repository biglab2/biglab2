# Who

Hi, it's me. I am new on Github. ðŸ‘‹

I am not a developper but I work with developpers. On my personnal time I love to work (for me it's playing :-) ) on my mac. I like mac stuff and mac applications.

I also like user guide and I like when a thing is well documented. I have an old mac so my attention was bring on an Github projec that I found really cool: *OpenCore Legacy*. So as my first contribution on a GitHub project I would like to participate to the user guide of that project. We will see...

Thanks,
